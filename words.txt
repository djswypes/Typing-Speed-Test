Using Tkinter and what you have learnt about building GUI applications with Python, build a desktop app that assesses your typing speed. Give the user some sample text and detect how many words they can type per minute. Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?
If you have more time, you can build your typing speed test into a typing trainer, with high scores and more text samples. You can design your program any way you want. This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer. The average typing speed is 40 words per minute. But with practice, you can speed up to 100 words per minute.
For the purposes of understanding how articles are used, it is important to know that nouns can be either count (can be counted) or noncount (indefinite in quantity and cannot be counted). In addition, count nouns are either singular (one) or plural (more than one). Noncount nouns are always in singular form for example, if we are speaking of water that has been spilled on the table, there can be one drop (singular) or two or more drops (plural) of water on the table.
However, if we are speaking of water in general spilled on the table, it would not be appropriate to count one water or two waters -- there would simply be water on the table. Water is a noncount noun. Therefore, according to the rules applying to noncount nouns, the word water would use no article or the, but not a following are the three specific rules which explain the use of definite and indefinite articles.
